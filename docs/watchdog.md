# Watchdog and child permissions

The watchdog is an opt-in adversarial reviewer for repo edits. This page covers what it reviews, how to pick its model, scope monitoring, LSP diagnostics, and the native child tool permission gate that uses the child watchdog as its arbiter.

## What the watchdog reviews

The watchdog is not the `reviewer` subagent. `subagents.defaultModel` and `subagents.agentOverrides.reviewer` do not configure it.

It reviews repo edits, not ordinary conversation:

- It runs at the safe `agent_end` boundary, only when the current agent or child writer changed the final repo state since the start of that turn.
- Multiple edits in one turn are coalesced into one review of the final changed state.
- Unchanged/reverted diffs are skipped.
- Generated `.pi/subagents/` or `tmp/` artifacts do not trigger review.
- In orchestrated runs, each writing child can review its own edited worktree, and the parent can still review the aggregate repo diff after child changes are applied.

## Choosing a model

Because the watchdog is an adversarial change reviewer, it should usually use a strong complementary model rather than a cheap/light one.

Ask pi-subagents for the current strong pairing:

```text
/subagents-watchdog recommend-model
/subagents-watchdog session model recommended
/subagents-watchdog model recommended
```

The current recommendation policy is Opus 4.8 with thinking high or GPT 5.5 with thinking high. If your main session is using one, the watchdog should use the other when that model is authenticated.

- `session model recommended` changes only the current Pi session.
- `model recommended` saves the recommendation to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`. It does not turn the watchdog on; enable it separately with `/subagents-watchdog on`.

Or set the model explicitly:

```text
/subagents-watchdog model anthropic/claude-opus-4-8:high
/subagents-watchdog model openai-codex/gpt-5.5:high
/subagents-watchdog model inherit
/subagents-watchdog check
```

In settings files, use `subagents.watchdog.main.model` and `subagents.watchdog.main.thinking` for the main watchdog:

- If `main.model` is omitted, the main watchdog uses the current session model and thinking level.
- If `main.model` is set without a thinking suffix or `main.thinking`, it runs with thinking off. Prefer `:high` or `"thinking": "high"` for the strong-watchdog pairing.

Default strong-reviewer profile:

```json
{
  "subagents": {
    "watchdog": {
      "enabled": true,
      "main": {
        "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-8",
        "thinking": "high"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Scope monitoring

When enabled, the watchdog keeps a bounded in-memory current-scope artifact from real user prompts and prepends it to review input by default (`subagents.watchdog.scope.enabled`). Newer prompts supersede and mutate older prompts, so the reviewer can flag work that no longer serves the current scope as `scope-drift`. Watchdog auto-follow prompts are not recorded as scope.

You can opt into Scopey-style scope monitoring, inspired by [Scopey](https://github.com/ArchAstro/scopey), by setting `subagents.watchdog.cadence.everyNTools` to run additional non-blocking reviews every N tool results. Cadence warnings are transcript-visible and delivered with Pi's `steer` mode after the current tool boundary; they are never hidden. The same configured watchdog model is used for all checks, so choose a cheap model for frequent monitoring or a strong model for rarer adversarial review.

Scopey-style profile:

```json
{
  "subagents": {
    "watchdog": {
      "enabled": true,
      "main": {
        "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
        "thinking": "medium"
      },
      "scope": { "enabled": true },
      "cadence": { "everyNTools": 10 },
      "autoFollow": {
        "blockers": true,
        "maxAttempts": 3,
        "stalemateRepeats": 3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Auto-follow

When the watchdog displays a blocker at `agent_end`, the `subagents.watchdog.autoFollow` policy can queue a visible follow-up user message asking the agent to address it. Auto-follow only runs while the watchdog is enabled, respects `maxAttempts`, and stops on repeated identical blockers using `stalemateRepeats`.

## LSP diagnostics

When the watchdog is enabled, it also checks changed TypeScript and JavaScript files for fresh language-server diagnostics before the model review.

- It auto-detects `typescript-language-server` from the project `node_modules/.bin` or `PATH`. It never installs tools or scans the whole workspace.
- LSP errors surface as watchdog blockers, warnings as concerns, and info/hints stay in status details.
- Slow or missing servers are reported in `/subagents-watchdog status` without blocking the turn or emitting late mid-turn warnings.
- Configure the bounds with `subagents.watchdog.lsp.enabled`, `timeoutMs`, `maxFiles`, and `maxDiagnostics`.

## Child watchdogs

For child subagent watchdogs, use `subagents.watchdog.children.model` as the default child watchdog model, or `subagents.watchdog.children.overrides.<agent>.model` for a specific child role.

Child watchdogs are opt-in and follow the same edit-gated rule: read-only children do not trigger watchdog reviews, while writer children are reviewed at their own `agent_end` if their worktree changed.

## Agent-driven configuration

Agents can configure the same values through the tool when you ask them to set up the watchdog:

```ts
subagent({ action: "watchdog.recommend-model" })
subagent({ action: "watchdog.configure", model: "recommended", scope: "session" })
subagent({ action: "watchdog.configure", model: "recommended", scope: "project" })
```

Persistent scopes (`user` or `project`) should only be used when you ask for a lasting default. Otherwise the agent should use `scope: "session"`.

## Native child tool permissions

Native permissions are opt-in and apply only to Pi child runtimes. With no rules configured, every tool call passes through unchanged.

Configure explicit non-bash rules globally in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent/config.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "rules": {
      "read": "allow",
      "write": "ask",
      "edit": "deny"
    }
  }
}
```

Custom agents can override matching global rules with a `permission:` or `permissions:` frontmatter block:

```yaml
---
name: worker
permission:
  write: allow
  edit: ask
---
```

Rules support `allow`, `ask`, and `deny`:

- Agent rules override matching global rules.
- Omitted and unknown tools default to `allow`.
- Explicit `allow` removes an inherited restriction.
- The gate is not registered when the resolved policy has no `ask` or `deny` rules.

### How `ask` works

An explicit `ask` pauses that exact tool call and sends a bounded, redacted preview to a one-call permission arbiter owned by the built-in child watchdog. The arbiter uses the configured child-watchdog model and returns only `approve` or `deny`; it does not notify the parent agent.

Enable and configure `subagents.watchdog.children` before using `ask` rules. A disabled watchdog, missing model/auth, timeout, malformed response, or runtime error denies the call with a clear error.

Asked requests and decisions are written to bounded audit JSONL, including `decisionSource: "watchdog"` and bounded failure reasons. Ordinary direction and clarification through `contact_supervisor` or the optional `pi-intercom` extension remain separate and are never permission-gated.

### Bash is out of scope

`bash` is always passed through by pi-subagents. Bash rules are rejected rather than parsed, gated, denied, or audited. Install and configure `pi-guard` when command-level bash policy is needed.

A pi-subagents child is headless, so a pi-guard rule that resolves to `ask` cannot request approval from the parent Pi UI. Native permissions do not forward pi-guard decisions; they only apply to the separate non-bash child permission gate. For child-specific policy, use `PI_GUARD` through a `PI_SUBAGENT_PI_BINARY` wrapper or an equivalent launch wrapper, and configure explicit `allow` or `deny` rules. An `allow` rule grants execution; it is not approval forwarding, so retain explicit denies for commands the child must not run.

### External CLI profiles

External CLI profiles are opaque processes, so native permissions cannot intercept their tools. A launch with effective `ask` or `deny` rules is rejected for an external CLI agent instead of claiming enforcement.
